# Mekanism-Sim

A suite of simulator and calculator LabVIEW VIs for Mekanism.

## License Notes

The models and calculators are based off of the math in Mekansim source code. Java can't be copy-pasted into LabVIEW, but the logic was brought over as written, so I feel the license should still be included here. It can be found as `LICENSE-Mekanism`.
